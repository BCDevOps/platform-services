## Workshop: Working with Zero-Trust Security Model in Openshift

##### Dec 2-3, 2019

### Next Gen App Security Project: Building DevSecOps for BC Gov

* Quick project overview

    * Started in Aug 2019, budget $1.35M, 4 people core Tech Team
    * Testing new security model with real-life applications - 3 production pilots in progress (JAG and NRS)

* Problem Statement

    * Adding Sec to DevOps : the security of the Openshift platform must be improved in order for ministry teams to continue utilizing current applications and to satisfy the demand for new ones.
    * Expanding Opinionated Developer Toolkit : real-time container scanning and secret management add-ons
    * Continuous STRA and PIA compliance check for platform applications

* Important Milestones:

    * Oct 8, 2019 - Aporeto software installed on Openshift
    * Oct 22, 2019 - Zero-Trust Network Security Model enabled
    * Oct 23, 2019 - Pilot #1  - FPO - complete

### What is the Zero Trust Model?

![](assets/Zero-Trust-Model.jpg)

### Why Aporeto?

* Why Kubernetes needs Zero Trust Networking?

  * In K8S environments IP addresses are dynamically assigned and carry no meaningful information
  * Applications have a much more rich identifier that includes their context (ie. metadata about the running
instance)

* Aporeto’s unique approach to Zero Trust Cloud Security

  * Implemented on levels 3-7 of OCI Model
  * Flows are authorized through network security policies based on application identity instead of IP addresses

* Every communication is authenticated , then authorized and optionally transparently encrypted
  * Provides seamless distributed policy management across Kubernetes multi-cluster and container
environments - on-prem and public clouds
  * Can extend into non-Kubernetes environments such as legacy infrastructure in network zones


### Our Implementation

* Aporeto Enforcers
  * Enabling the enforcement of network security policies
  * Distributed in key control points of the network - Openshift cluster nodes, HA proxies in Zone B
  * Installed and maintained by DXC Ad Sol

* Aporeto Network Security Policy
  * Network Security rules defined at multiple levels (hierarchy based)
  * Application specific policies in YAML format
    * inherit rules from parent levels
    * Uni-directional, e.g. for bi-directional flow must be enabled on both sides of the connection
    * Developer-controlled via NetworkSecurityPolicy Custom Resource Definition (CRD)
    * Automatic backups to a private repo for restore and audit purposes

* Aporeto Security Orchestrator (aka Control Plane, aka Console)
  * Available as SaaS on GCP https://console.aporeto.com
  * Responsible for policy management, data collection, analytics, and UI for policy visualization
  * Read-Only Access for Developers is coming soon


### Impact on OpenShift Platform Users

* Guiding Implementation Principle

    * Increased security and compliance built into the Platform balanced with flexibility in adoption andbcontrol by developers (ie. self-service Network Security Policy management)

* Existing applications
  * deployed to OCP prior Oct 8, 2019
  * pre-populated with 3 basic network security policies to operate “as is”
  * No impact until OCP 4.2 upgrade

* New applications
   * deployed to OCP after Oct 8, 2019
   * No communication flows allowed by default (ie. Zero-Trust)
   * Require custom network security policies to be developed to enable communications

### Custom Network Security Policy

* Configuration files used by Aporeto to authenticate and authorize communication flows

* Added to an application as Custom Resource Definition (CRD) NetworkSecurityPolicy ” in YAML format

* Special operator translates YAML to Aporeto native language behind the scene

* Identity labels uniquely describe each Processing Unit ( authentication ) that the policy must apply to

* Custom Network Security Policy describes what communication flow - ingress and egress - is allowed for the Processing Unit ( authorization )

### Network Security Policy Ownership Model

### (Work in Progress)


### Base Custom Network Security Policies

* Intended as a workaround to allow existing applications to continue functioning “as is” with new Zero Trust Model enabled on the Platform
  * **Are NOT the best practice for application’s network security!**

* Focuses on allowing 3 flows:
  * Within the namespace - pod to pod communications
  * From the namespace to the K8S/OpenShift API - for builds/deployments/etc.
  * From the namespace to Internet and external networks - for egress traffic

* **Must be included in the app’s deployment config in order to migrate to OCP 4**

* **Must be replaced with the policies matching application’s unique security requirements** 

### Intra-Namespace: Pod-to-Pod Base Policy 

* Allows all pods in a namespace to
communicate between themselves
* Not all pods need to talk to all pods -> policy
override leads to better security
* Policy Override Tips:
  * For bi-directional flow each pod in the pair must
have a matching policy
  * Some pods need to talk to themselves!
* Some best practices:
  * Only backend pod can talk to the database pod -
uni-directional
  * Only front-end pod can talk to the backend-end
pod - uni-directional (see Example)
  * Database pod shouldn’t need to initiate any
requests.

Example: 
```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/ v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: intra-namespace-comms-uwsgva-dev
        labels:
            name: ${NAME}
            app: ${APP_NAME}
            env: ${TAG_NAME}
    spec:
        Description: Allow the namespace uwsgva-dev pods to talk to each other.
source:
        destination:
         - - $namespace=uwsgva-dev
        source:
         - - $namespace=uwsgva-dev
```
Replace with custom policy for each required pod to pod communication. 

**Tip: A policy is only required on the connection initiating side, i.e. Pod A has a policy that allows it to initiate a connection to Pod B and Pod B will be able to respond to it. If Pod B needs to initiate a connection to Pod B, then it will need a separate policy.**

Example:
```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/ v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: intra-namespace-comms-uwsgva-dev
        labels:
            name: ${NAME}
            app: ${APP_NAME}
            env: ${TAG_NAME}
    spec:
        Description: Allow the frontend (web) to talk to the api pod.
        source:
            - - role=web
            - app=${APP_NAME}
            - env=${TAG_NAME}
        destination:
            - - role=api
            - app=${APP_NAME}
            - env=${TAG_NAME}
```
**Tip: "--" in YAML means "OR". "-" means "AND".** The source above translates to "apply this policy to a pod that has a label "role=api" AND the label "app=${APP_NAME}" AND the label "env=${TAG_NAME}".


### Namespace-to-External-Networks Base Policy 


* Allows all pods in a namespace to access Internet
and external networks (egress)
* Not all pods need to talk to Internet -> policy
override leads to better security
* Policy Override Tips:
  * Restrict access to Internet as much as possible
  * Access from Internet (ingress) to a pod is governed
by OCP Routes
* Some best practices:
  * Only keep this policy in -TOOLS namespace to
allow builds (access to GitHub, etc), remove from
other namespaces

Example:
```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: namespace-to-external-network-aajsw-dev
        labels:
            name: namespace-to-external-network
            env: ${ENV_NAME}
    spec:
    description: Allow all pods in the namespace to access the internet.
    source:
        - - $namespace=aajsw-dev
    destination:
        - - ext:network=any

```
Replace with a custom policy for each pod that is required to connect to Internet/external networks.

Example:

```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: pod-to-external-network-aajsw-dev
        labels:
            name: pod-to-external-network
            env: ${ENV_NAME}
    spec:
    description: Allow the front-end pod in the namespace to access the internet.
    source:
        - - role=web
        - app=${APP_NAME}
        - env=${TAG_NAME}
    destination:
        - - ext:network=any
```


### Namespace-to-K8S-API Base Policy 

* Allows all pods to talk to the internal
Kubernetes API
* Required for builds, deployments and
auto-scaling
* Some best practices:
  * Use the Cluster API endpoint for quick
testing
https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local:443
  * Run regular builds and deployments for
thorough testing

Example:
```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: int-cluster-k8s-api-comms-aajsw-dev
    labels:
        name: pods-to-api
        app: ${APP_NAME}
        env: ${TAG_NAME}
    spec:
        description: Allow pods in the namespace to talk to the internal api
        source:
            - - $namespace=aajsw-dev
        destination:
            - - int:network=internal-cluster-api-endpoint
```
Replace with a custom policy for each pod that is required to connect to internal Kubernetes API.

Example:
```
- kind: NetworkSecurityPolicy
    apiVersion: secops.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/v1alpha
    metadata:
        name: int-cluster-k8s-api-comms-aajsw-dev
    labels:
        name: pod-to-api
        app: ${APP_NAME}
        env: ${TAG_NAME}
    spec:
        description: Allow patroni database pod in the namespace to talk to the internal api
        source:
            - - role=database
            - app=${APP_NAME}
            - env=${TAG_NAME}
        destination:
            - - int:network=internal-cluster-api-endpoint
```
### Custom Network Security Policy Development

* Identify custom security requirements/rules for your application (whiteboard network diagrams)
* Assign identity labels t o all processing units, e.g. pods the policies will apply to
* Develop custom network security policy to implement the rules
* Replace the default base policies with the the custom policies in a non-prod environment
* Test and repeat in all environments including -TOOLS!
  * Check out [testConnection.sh](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools/blob/master/bin/testConnection) script in openshift-developer-tools repo in BCDevOps and
[testConnections.txt](sample/testConnections.txt) with sample test endpoints in platform-services/security repo
* Store policies in the application’s repo in the folder corresponding to the pod it applies to and that initiates the connection
    Check the [FPO](https://github.com/bcgov/Family-Protection-Order) repo for examples. Search for "NetworkSecurity" in the repo.
* Follow [Policy Naming Conventions](https://github.com/BCDevOps/platform-services/blob/master/security/aporeto/architecture/design_decisions.md#policy-naming-conventions) listed in Dev Guide for NetworkSecurity in DevHub, i.e. <flow
description>-<app-namespace>-<environment>, and best practices described above.


### Our Heroes (aka Pilots)

* Have specific security requirements that cannot be met by 3 basic policies

* Help the project team to test out different design patterns for the benefit of the entire developer community

* **Family Protection Order (FPO) pilot** by AG

    * Close off communications within an OCP namespace

* **RoadSafetyBC pilot** by RSI

    * Enable OCP namespace to namespace communication and into the JAG Zone B

* **Mines Digital Services** by NRM

    * Enable the OCP namespace into the NRM Zone B communications

* **BC Registries pilot** (accidental)
    * Enable OCP namespace to namespace communication
    * When Zero-Trust Model was enabled on the Platform, BC Registries namespaces lost the ability to talk to each other and required a namespace-to-namespace policy in order to enable this communication again.

* (Future pilot) **EPIC Cloud Migration Pilot** by NRM
    * Enable the OCP namespace into the public cloud (Azure) communication

### Lab Time!

* Prerequisites
  * Admin access to a non-production namespace in the Openshift Platform
  * Have the [sample policy file](sample/quickstart-nsp.yaml) handy
  * Clone https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools and include /bin in your
PATH
  * Copy [testConnection.txt](sample/testConnections.txt) file from platform-services repo, update with a list all deployments within your namespace

### Fun with Custom Network Security Policy

* View 3 base policies in your namespace (**oc login ... first**)
 ``` 
  oc get networksecuritypolicy
  oc describe networksecuritypolicy <POLICY_NAME>
  oc get networksecuritypolicy <POLICY_NAME> -o yaml > temp/<POLICY_NAME>.yaml (repeat for each)
```
* Remove the base policies
```  
  oc delete networksecuritypolicy <POLICY_NAME> (repeat for each)
```
* Test connectivity
```
 ./testConnection -n <NAMESPACE_NAME> -p <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> -f <PATH_TO>/testConnections.txt
```
* Recreate the base policies
  * Open the sample policy file
  * Copy a sample policy into a local YAML file named **custom-<POLICY_NAME_IN_FILE>-<NAMESPACE_NAME>.yaml** and update with your details
```
oc apply -f networksecuritypolicy <YAML_FILE>.yaml
```
* Test again!
