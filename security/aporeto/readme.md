# Aporeto Zero Trust Network Security Enforcement
The Aporeto solution is a multi-cluster multi-cloud zero trust network solution that will deny all traffic from all processing units until expliticly allowed. For the purpose of the OpenShift environment, a "Pod" is considered a "Processing Unit". This solution creates an "identity" for each processing unit that allows for much more granular access control policies beyond a simple network address.
