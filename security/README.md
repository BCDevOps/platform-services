**Next Gen Application Security Project**

**The B I G Idea**

![raccon](aporeto/docs/assets/racoon.png)

What if we could develop the <b>most secure application deployment environment</b> in the BC Government?..


How would life change for **brilliant developers** across all ministries who struggle getting their genius products to prime time, in time?

How would nights change for **innovative technology leaders,** sleeping with one eye openâ€”on constant vigil for invasive security threats and attacks?

How would services change for **engaged public citizens** who crave safe and timely access to the muscle and power of our government&#39;s growing business strength?

Bring on the change!

We're advancing forward with the emerging **Zero-Trust Model** to take our **DevOps Openshift Platform** to the next level. Working closely with the teams that use OpenShift every day, our new **Cloud Enabled** security model and **expanded toolkit** will include premium security capabilities, such as:

- real-time container scanning for vulnerabilities
- secrets management
- real-time threat response, and
- security posture dashboard and continuous STRA/PIA compliance check.
