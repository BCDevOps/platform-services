# Sysdig Application Monitoring

### Purpose
Sysdig is the centralized monitoring tool to support both Monitoring Operations teams and Application teams across the Pathfinder platform. This solution will remove the dependency on "in cluster" monitoring tools and will scale well with additional clusters and cloud workloads.
