# Authentication
Sysdig is configured with OpenID Connect to leverage the Pathfinder Keycloak SSO instance for authentication. 

## OpenID Connect Configuration
Keycloak and Sysdig were configured manually for the OIDC integration (sad face :( )). The following screenshots were used to configure each component. The secrets tab in the Keycloak SSO instance was used to gather secret for the Sysdig configuration.
